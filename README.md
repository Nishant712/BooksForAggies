# BooksForAggies

This is a book sharing website developed to help the students of Texas A&M University get access to books not found in the library. Being a bunch of college grads, we constantly feel the need to get books which are not available in the library. 

This website allows the students to rent a book for semester long period or for shorter periods during the semester from fellow students. It also has the feature to find other students who are willing to buy the same book and therefore allowing the students to tackle the money issue by splitting the cost. Also, they can further make use of this website to give away the book at the end of the semester. The website was designed using Ruby on Rails and was deployed on Heroku. Github, RSpec, Cucumber, Pivotal Tracker, etc. were other tools that were used during development.
